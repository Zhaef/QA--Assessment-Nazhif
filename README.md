Quality Assurance Assessment Submission
This repository contains my submission for the Quality Assurance (QA) internship/entry-level position.
As a beginner with no formal QA experience, I have completed this assessment to the best of my understanding and capability. This project includes:
- Basic understanding of QA tasks
- Sample manual test cases I wrote after reading tutorials
-  A simple test plan format I followed from online references
- Some research and understanding of automation tools like Postman and Selenium
- I am highly interested in learning QA in a real work environment and believe I can grow quickly with the right mentorship and guidance.
